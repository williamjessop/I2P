                    <p>Come to us, to prevent violence in our community. 
                        Violence comes in all shapes and sizes, 
                        but there are prevalent concepts that can be taught to anyone to 
                        look out for this unwanted behavior.
                         We are a safe space for discussing violence and we look to teach you the 
                         steps to protect yourself and your peers. Letâ€™s talk about prevention 
                         and let us aid in the prevention of violence. </p>
